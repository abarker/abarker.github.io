   \section*{Notes for My Paper}

   Don't forget to include examples of topicalization.
   They look like this:

   {\small
   \enumsentence{Topicalization from sentential subject:\\ 
   \shortex{7}{a John$_i$ [a & kltukl & [el & 
     {\bf l-}oltoir & er & ngii$_i$ & a Mary]]}
   { & {\bf R-}clear & {\sc comp} & 
     {\bf IR}.{\sc 3s}-love   & P & him & }
   {John, (it's) clear that Mary loves (him).}}
   }

   \subsection*{How to handle topicalization}

   Don't!

   \subsection*{Mood}

   Mood changes when there is a topic, as well as when
   there is WH-movement.  \emph{Irrealis} is the mood when
   there is a non-subject topic or WH-phrase in Comp.
   \emph{Realis} is the mood when there is a subject topic
   or WH-phrase.
